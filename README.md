# LetterBoxD to JustWatch Filter

LetterBoxD to JutWatch Filter is a tool that allows you to determine which movies from a LetterBoxD list is available for stream or rent based on the services you're suscribed to (or the ones you're willing to pay for).
For now it is available only as a cli version, but a GUI is on the way.

Right now it searches the movies using the french JustWatch version, but an international version is on the way too.

Feel free to make any contribution / raise issues
